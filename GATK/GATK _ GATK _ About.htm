            	<small>Simply what it says on the can: a Toolkit for Genome Analysis</small></h2>
              	<hr />
				<p>Say you have ten exomes and you want to identify the rare mutations they all have in common – the GATK can do that. Or you need to know which mutations are specific to a group of patients, as opposed to a healthy cohort – the GATK can do that too. In fact, the GATK is the industry standard for such analyses.</p>
				<br>
            	<div class="row-fluid">
            		<div class="span6">
               			<h4>But wait, there's more!</h4>
						<p>Because of the way it is built, the GATK is highly generic and can be applied to all kinds of datasets and genome analysis problems. It can be used for discovery as well as for validation. It's just as happy handling exomes as whole genomes. It can use data generated with a variety of different sequencing technologies. It can handle RNAseq data. And although it was originally developed for human genetics, the GATK has evolved to handle genome data from any organism, with any level of ploidy. Your plant has six copies of each chromosome? Bring it on.</p>

						<h4>So what's in the can?</h4>
						<p>At the heart of the GATK is an industrial-strength infrastructure and engine that handle data access, conversion and traversal, as well as high-performance computing features. On top of that lives a rich ecosystem of specialized tools, called "walkers", that you can use out of the box, individually or chained into scripted workflows, to perform anything from simple data diagnostics to complex "reads-to-results" analyses.</p>
						<p>Some typical workflows are detailed on the next page of this section. Please see the <a href="../guide/tooldocs/">Tool Documentation</a> section for a complete list of tools and their capabilities.</p>

		        		<h4>Platform and requirements</h4>
						<p>The GATK is designed to run on Linux and other POSIX-compatible platforms. Yes, that includes MacOS X! If you are on any of the above, see the <a href="../download">Downloads</a> section for downloading and installation instructions. If you're stuck with Windows, you're not completely out of luck – it's possible to use the GATK with Cygwin, although we can't provide any specific support for that. If you're on something else... no, there are no plans to port the GATK to Android or iOS in the near future.</p>
						<p>You will need to have Java installed  to run the GATK, and some tools additionally require R to generate PDF plots. Version requirements and installation instructions for both can be found in the <a href="../guide">Documentation Guide</a>.</p>

						<p>If that is not something you are used to, or you have no idea what that even means, don't worry. It's easier to learn than you might think, and there are many good <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything">online tutorials</a> that can get help you get comfortable with the command-line environment.

						<h4>Command structure and tool arguments</h4>
						<p>All the GATK tools are called using the same basic command structure. Here's a simple example that counts the number of sequence reads in a BAM file:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \
	-T CountReads \
	-R example_reference.fasta \
	-I example_reads.bamgsaw
</pre>
						<p>The <code>-jar</code> argument invokes the GATK engine itself, and the <code>-T</code> argument tells it which tool you want to run.  Arguments like <code>-R</code> for the genome reference and <code>-I</code> for the input file are also given to the GATK engine and can be used with all the tools (see complete list of <a href="../guide/tooldocs/org_broadinstitute_sting_gatk_CommandLineGATK.html">available arguments for the GATK engine</a>. Most tools also take additional arguments that are specific to their function. These are listed for each tool on that tool's documentation page, all easily accessible through the <a href="../guide/tooldocs/">Tool Documentation</a> index.</p>

		        <hr />
				<p>When you're isolating DNA in the lab, you don't treat the work like isolated, disconnected tasks. Every task is a step in a well-documented protocol, carefully developed to optimize yield, purity and to ensure reproducibility as well as consistency across all samples and experiments.</p>
		        <p><strong>We believe working with NGS data should be exactly the same.</strong></p>
				<p>That's why we have developed industry-standard workflows that are optimized to produce the most accurate results from your dataset, with the most efficiency in terms of both manual handling and computational cost.</p>
				<br />
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span4">
						<h4>NGS data processing<br></h4>
						<p>Whatever the sequencing technology you're using, you need to process the raw dataset to make it suitable for analysis. These <a href="?dpp">data processing workflows</a> guide you through the necessary steps, with detailed explanations of each operation, why it is required and what transformations are applied to the data.</p>

						<h4>Variant discovery, genotyping and filtering</h4>
						<p>Finding sequence variation within and between samples is fairly straightforward. Distinguishing what part of that variation is real and assigning the right genotypes is a heck of a lot more difficult. These variant discovery, genotyping and filtering workflows and protocols help you choose the parameters that are most appropriate for your dataset and guides you through the necessary steps to produce a variant callset that you can trust. Various options are available depending on whether you're working with whole genomes or exomes and according to the type, number and coverage depth of your samples.</p>

	            		<h4>Muli-threading</h4>
						<p>The GATK takes advantage of the latest processors using multi-threading, i. e. run using multiple cores on the same machine. Multi-threading is enabled simply by using the <code>-nt</code> and <code>-nct</code> command line arguments. See <a href="../guide/article?id=1975">this article</a> for details.</p>

						<h4>Out on the farm with Queue</h4>
						<p>Queue is a companion program that allows the GATK to take parallelization to the next level: running jobs on a high-performance computing cluster, or server farm.</p>
						<p>Queue manages the entire process of breaking down big jobs into many smaller ones (scatter) then collecting and merging results when they are done (gather).</p>
						<p>At the Broad, we use a Queue pipeline to run GATK analyses on hundreds, even thousands of exomes, on our cluster of hundreds of nodes.</p>

				<p>The GATK has a reputation for being wicked complicated, and it's not entirely undeserved. With great power comes great <del>responsibility</del> complexity... But don't panic! Help is at hand.</p>
				<p>Our crack team of space monkeys has put together a revolutionary documentation and support system to help you get the answers you need, fast and with the least amount of pain. It's composed of reference guides, tutorials, videos and a forum that are all cross-connected, so that relevant material from various sources is automatically aggregated for you, whether you're browsing an index or searching by keyword.</p>
				<p>All that time you'll save on looking for information and troubleshooting? Feel free to use it to get even more work done... or finally have a life!</p>

					<p>If you've ever wondered "Is there a tool that can do X?" or "Does this tool have an argument to do Y?", the <a href="../guide/tooldocs/">Technical Documentation</a> should be your first stop.</p>
					<p>Every tool in the GATK has its own article detailing what it does and how it does it, as well as all the available options, default parameter values and argument names. There are also articles detailing options and arguments of the GATK engine, which are common to all GATK tools, and documenting companion software such as Queue.</p>

                        <h4>Free for academics, fee for commercial use</h4>
                        <p>The GATK and its sister program, MuTect, are increasingly used not just in academic research, but also in clinical and commercial production environments. In order to sustain a development team that can meet the high standards required for the quality of the software itself as well as the support that we provide, we release GATK and MuTect under a mixed licensing model. This means that researchers at academic and non-profit organizations can access the tools and source code for free, while for-profit organizations are required to purchase a license. The revenue generated by this model is then used to fund and build out our support team and infrastructure to accommodate the demand for support in the community, as well as invest more resources to improve development speed, functionality and stability overall.</p>

                         <h4>Direct licensing and support through Broad</h4>
                    <p>As of April 16, 2015, we are providing licensing and support directly to commercial/for-profit organizations that will be running the GATK or MuTect internally or as part of their own hardware offering. This new licensing arrangement will allow licensed customers better access to the GATK and MuTect development and support teams, full support for the latest releases of our tools, and the most up-to-date Best Practice recommendations that are based on our team's extensive analysis and R&D work. Users who currently hold a license purchased through our former commercial partner, Appistry, will continue to be supported by Appistry until their license expires, at which time they will have the opportunity to renew their license through the Broad Institute. All users are welcome to enjoy the support we offer for free through the forum.</p>

						<h4>Free for academics, fee for commercial use</h4>
						<p>The GATK is increasingly used not just by academic researchers, but by commercial companies who have needs, in terms of support and production readiness, that are beyond what our small development team can provide. Charging a licensing fee for commercial use gives us the means to provide upgraded support for those users, as well as invest more resources to improve development speed, functionality and stability overall. That being said, we remain committed to providing free access to the full-featured GATK for non-commercial use by the academic scientific community.</p>

		            <div class="span6">
						<h4>Mixed closed/open-source model </h4>
						<p>The entire GATK engine and infrastructure (i.e. the programming framework) as well as a large number of utility tools are open-source and provided to all free of charge under the original MIT license. The source code for the full GATK suite (which also includes the Best Practices tools) is freely available for non-commercial use to the academic research community; while commercial users may obtain access to the source code if they purchase a license from our partner, <a href='http://www.appistry.com/'>Appistry</a>.
